    """Task that sends due scheduled tasks for execution.

    Each DB operation must be in its own commit so that even if
    send_scheduled_task is called multiple times concurrently, a task is
    ensured to only be sent **at most once**. If a crash occurs while sending a
    task, the task will stay indefinitely in the SCHEDULED state while having a
    schedule id.

    1. Tasks due to be executed are marked with a schedule id. This prevents
        the task from being sent for execution twice.

    2. Each task marked by the schedule id is sent for exeuction without an
        ETA.

    3. We change the status from SCHEDULED to SCHEDULED SENT after a task is
        being sent for execution.

    **IMPORTANT: ** Never call this task inside an atomic block or you could
    end up sending tasks more than once. Always use autocommit (each SQL query
    executed in its own transaction).
